# Quantum Mechanics Simulations
A collection of scripts to simulate and animate position space solutions of the time independent [dependent] Sch&ouml;dinger Equation: `H$\psi$(x) = Epsi(x) [psi(x, t) = exp(iHt)psi(x)]`.

## Shoot
This simulation uses the shooting method, or "wagging the tail" to numerically solve for the wavefunctions of the unidimensional Schr&ouml;dinger equation, for arbitrary potentials in 1D, including the radial equation for spherically symmetric potentials.  Instead of using Euler's method for numerical integration, this simulation utilizes Numerov's method, a 4th order implicit method suited for equations of the form we are looking at here.

I really need to figure out how to include LaTeX in here.
