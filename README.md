# Quantum Mechanics Simulations

## Shooter
This simulation uses the shooting method, or "wagging the tail" to numerically solve for the wavefunctions of the unidimensional Schr&ouml;dinger equation, for arbitrary potentials in 1D, including the radial equation for spherically symmetric potentials.  Instead of using Euler's method for numerical integration, this simulation utilizes Numerov's method, a 4th order implicit method suited for equations of the form we are looking at here.

I really need to figure out how to include LaTeX in here.
